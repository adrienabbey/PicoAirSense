# PicoAirSense

RasPi Pico-based Indoor Environment Monitor

## The Goal

- Monitor indoor air quality, humidity, temperature, and pressure.
- Develop skills and experience working with microcontrollers.
  - Use Fritzing to create wiring schematics.
- Use a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, an E-Ink display, and several sensors to do this.
